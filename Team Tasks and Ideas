Things that need to get done:

Presentation data collection and charts
  -It looks like they want us to use their already-collected datase
  -Could we look for demographics that display ages 18-60 (working class), physicians in-training, 
   people struggling with healthcare, people with mental health issues (rare & common), people who have access to technology,
   and people in-need of using technology to their advantage?
  -It is ok if we don't find all the ones on this list. We'll figure itout as we go.
  -For the last 2 on the list, I want to use it to justify why we are using technology instead of something else.

Research:
  -Gamer instincts. What makes people want to continue playing games? What makes a game satisfying? 
   How can we use that to advantage to encourage mental health care?

App/website needs:
  -Pomodoro timer 
    -"How much time do you have?"
    -Options for 5, 10, 15 minutes or user input
        -If user input, check for ways this option could break when debugging
  
    -Ideas:
        -Tasks could be levels
        -Needs 2 modes. One for ascending to your peak (visualized by going up a mountain trail) 
         and one going down from your peak amount of stress (visualized by going down the mountain)
          -I would like to acknowledge some quiet activities for bad timings (like needing to scream when the household is sleeping) 
          -Would it benefit the user if time of day is reflected in the app/wesite in terms of changes in the environment?
        
        -ASMR for calming effect?
            -For this, needs to have good sound equipment and be able to test it on many different types of speakers
        -Tasks for in-game garden
        -Being able to track mental health days for user's and doctor's reference
            -An option to be able to send progress to your doctor
            -We want the users to be encouraged to use this app at least once a day
        -Importing resources
            -Need to have a disclaimer because we are not experts (yet) on the effectiveness 
             of these exercises and are not liable for anything that happens to the user.
            -Sounds a bit harsh, but lets be humans with morals when helping the user navigate their challenges
        -Translating and teaching mental health techniques
        -How to we want to track whether a user has completed a task or not?

        -Turning mental health techniques into gamefied activities
            -This might be a long list
